# Miscelanea

Here we are listing components that are quite specific and doesn't have a place in a global section. This doesn't mean the components cannot be used out of the context since they are pretty generic markup and styling, but they just doesn't fit out of here.

## Accumulator Breadcrumb

This component is used in the Twitter Ads Dashboard to indicate the return of investment showing an accumulator with each operation cost and revenue in a Twitter Ads campaign. It's pretty similar to the breadcrumb component.
