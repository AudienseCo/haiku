# Buttons

Buttons are used for actions, like in forms, while textual hyperlinks are used for destinations, or moving from one page to another.

## Regular buttons

This buttons have a solid style and they are mostly related to the colors in your [palette](/docs/colors). You can use a link of a button tag element and style it using the class `.btn`. This will give you a base button. Then, if you want to have a specific kind of button, add a class `.btn-name` being name the name of the button. The button will display different styles for hover, active and disabled status. Here you have some examples.
