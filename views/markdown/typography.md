# Typography

Here we will be grouping all elements directly related to typography. They are not necessarily the same as the markdown styles shown here. Headings, paragraphs, lists and quotes are examples to be listed here.

## Headings

We have style for the six different headings with different sizes each; except for the `h6` heading that has the same size as the `h5` but with lighter color.

{% set component = "partial/headings.html" %}
{% include "partial/example.html" %}
