# Forms

This sections lists all components related to forms except for [buttons](/docs/buttons) that have their own section. We have forms layout components and individual form components styling.

## Input groups

This allows to attach a label or a button action to a text input. There are some styles in the browser that cannot be overwritten so an extra DOM node is needed in the case of an attached button.

{{ component('components/forms/input-groups.html') }}
