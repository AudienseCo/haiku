# Lists

This section contains styles for lists.

## Simple list

This is the most simple list in SocialBro. Defines some styles in order to have padding and separation between items. There is a little padding vertical spacing in the list container by default. Also there is always a hover style for each item assuming that the list is selectable. If your list is not selectable you can use a `non-selectable` modifier.
